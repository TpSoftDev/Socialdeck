- [ ] **NEVER create .md files for plans** - Discuss in chat
- [ ] **ALWAYS use full Figma variable names** (e.g., `borderRadiusZero`, not `zero`)
- [ ] **ALWAYS scan for duplication** before starting
- [ ] **ALWAYS create visual diagrams** when helpful

### 📊 Before Starting
- [ ] Read codebase thoroughly

### 🔨 Implementation Phase
- [ ] Do ONE file/change at a time
- [ ] Show what was done
- [ ] Wait for review
- [ ] Apply feedback/refinements
- [ ] Only continue after "ready" or "next"

### 🎨 Visual Documentation
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Show file organization
- [ ] Show mapping tables
- [ ] Help visualize changes

### ✅ Completion Check
- [ ] All names match Figma exactly
- [ ] All values match Figma exactly
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Code follows styling patterns
- [ ] Visual diagrams created
